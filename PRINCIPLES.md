## Core Principles

1. **Offline Comes First**  
   The app must work fully without an internet connection. Users should be able to create, view, and edit their data anytime, anywhere.

2. **Never Lose Data**  
   User data is sacred. Every action must be designed to prevent accidental loss—whether from crashes, sync conflicts, or user error.

3. **Sync Happens Quietly and Reliably**  
   Changes made on one device should eventually appear on all others. Sync should be automatic, conflict-aware, and never interrupt the user.

4. **Simple Enough for a 5-Year-Old**  
   The interface must be intuitive and friendly for all ages. If a child or grandparent can’t figure it out, it’s too complicated.

5. **No Surprises**  
   The app should behave predictably. Actions should have clear outcomes, and users should always feel in control of their data.

6. **Separation of Concerns**  
   Data storage, sync logic, and user interface must be cleanly separated in the codebase. This ensures flexibility, testability, and long-term maintainability.

7. **Respect the User’s Intent**  
   Whether online or offline, the app should always honor what the user tried to do—even if it can’t complete the action immediately.

8. **Design for the Family, Not Just the Tech-Savvy**  
   Every design decision should consider the needs of non-technical users. Accessibility, clarity, and delight are non-negotiable.

9. **Conflicts Are Resolved Gracefully**  
   When sync conflicts happen, the app should guide users through resolution with clarity and kindness—never with cryptic errors or data loss.

10. **Every Byte Has a Home**  
   All user data must be stored intentionally and retrievably. No orphaned records, no silent overwrites, no black holes.
