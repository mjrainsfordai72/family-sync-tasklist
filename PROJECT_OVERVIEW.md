family-sync-tasklist — Project Overview

📝 Summary

family-sync-tasklist is a cross‑platform Flutter/Dart application designed to give your family a simple, shared space for managing tasks and shopping lists. Every item supports inline comments, making it easy to clarify details, coordinate errands, and keep everyone aligned. The app is built with an offline‑first mindset, ensuring it works smoothly even without connectivity and syncs changes automatically once the device is back online.

🧩 The Problem It Solves

Your family currently juggles tasks and shopping reminders across scattered notes, messages, and conversations. Items get lost, duplicated, or forgotten entirely. This project aims to centralize that chaos into a single, reliable list that everyone can access—whether they’re at home, out shopping, or temporarily offline.

⭐ Key Features

Shared Task & Shopping ListA unified list that all family members can view and update in real time (or as soon as they’re back online).

Inline Comments on Each ItemAdd clarifications, reminders, or quick discussions directly under any task or shopping entry.

Offline‑First ArchitectureThe app remains fully usable without internet access. All changes are stored locally and synced later.

Eventual Sync Across DevicesWhen connectivity returns, updates are merged and synchronized across all platforms and family members.
